# Stellar Classification Using Machine Learning

This project involves building and evaluating machine learning classifiers to categorize celestial objects—specifically stars, galaxies, and quasars—using a provided dataset. The models implemented in this project include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, and Decision Tree. After a thorough comparison, the Decision Tree model emerged as the most effective classifier for this task.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying celestial objects into one of the three categories: stars, galaxies, or quasars. By leveraging various classification algorithms, we aim to determine the best approach for this specific task.
